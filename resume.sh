I'm resuming the Date Night project — a home-lab movie watchlist app for Ian and Krista.

Design and planning are complete. Implementation has not started. Please:

1. Read the implementation plan at docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-10-datenight.md
2. Use the superpowers:subagent-driven-development skill to execute it task by task, starting at Task 1

The design spec is at docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-datenight-design.md if you need context on decisions. UI mockups are in docs/mockups/.
